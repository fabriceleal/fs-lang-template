# fs-lang-template
FsLex-FsYacc lang development project template for F# (VS11).
Because at the date of creation, project templates for VS didnt work.

Simple lexer/parser included for reference. This structure was used in another project of mine: [Pang](https://github.com/fabriceleal/Pang)

To create the template, open the project in VS2012 and export it youself! :)
